# Make Your Own

If you'd like to make your own theme, simply follow this. <br/> <br/>

You should have an Image Editing tool that can: <br/> <br/>

- Blur <br/>
- Generate Noise <br/>
- Control Brightness/Contrast <br/> <br/>

I will be using Paint.NET. <br/><br/>

You should also have the MicaCustom theme downloaded through the pack! <br/><br/><br/>


- First, Open your Wallpaper of choice, <br/>
and Gaussian Blur until it resembles a gradient color. <br/>
Touch up the brightness so that nothing is TOO black, and more of a dark gray tone. <br/><br/>

Save this as "primary". <br/><br/>

- Next, Blur your "primary" image even further, <br/>
and adjust the bright/contrast so that it's JUST slightly brighter. <br/>
Generate a low-intensity noise (no color!) that's noticeable but not too strong. <br/><br/>

When you have it how you think looks nice, <br/>
Save this as "secondary". <br/><br/>

- Now, adjust your bright/contrast, <br/>
so that your "secondary" image is only slightly, but noticably darker, than your "primary" image. Don't overdo it! <br/>
If the noise is less noticeable because of this, generate a low-intensity noise. <br/><br/>

Save this as "tertiary". <br/><br/><br/>


You should now have three different images: <br/>
"primary", "secondary", and "tertiary". <br/>
Secondary should be the brightest, while Tertiary should be the darkest. <br/><br/>

Upload these three images to https://imgur.com/ (or something similar, but imgur works best), <br/>
and collect direct image links to each background. (each link should end in a file extension, such as ".png"). <br/><br/>

Open the MicaCustom.theme.css file you have earlier. <br/><br/>

All you should need to do now is replace each link to its corresponding variable!<br/>
("--background-primary" gets the imgur link corresponding to "primary.png", etc.)<br/><br/>

That should be it!
